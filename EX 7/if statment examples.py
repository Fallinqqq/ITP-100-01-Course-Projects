# If Statement examples

"""if 2 + 2 == 4:
    print("2 and 2 is 4")"""
# will print out the print() because it is true.

""" if 2 + 2 == 5
    print("Is this the mirror universe?")"""
# will pop up a invalid syntax error because there is no :

"""grade = 95

if grade >= 70:
    print("you passed the class!")
    
    print("Thank you for attending.")"""
# since 95 is greater than 70 it is true and print as stated.

""""grade = 40

if grade >= 70:
    print("You passed the class!")

    if grade < 70:
        print("you did not pass the class :")

        print("Thank you for attending.")"""""
# since 40 is less than 70 it is false that said grade did not pass the class.
